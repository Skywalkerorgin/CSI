# CSPA
Climate System Phase Analysis is a framework which allow capturing the state of multiple climate signals and improve seasonal forecast. CSPA is composed of four steps:  
- The detection of relevant climate teleconnections is performed by means of the [Nino Index Phase Analysis](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015WR017644), which categorizes years by climate phase and, for each phase, identifies preseason SST anomalies statistically significantly correlated with local conditions.
- The seasonal precipitation forecasts are generated by a nonlinear, multivariate Extreme Learning Machine model conditioned on the preseason SST for the relevant teleconnections detected in the previous step.
- The hydrologic forecasts are produced through a temporal downscaling procedure of the seasonal precipitation forecast to feed a hydrologic model.
- The forecast operational value is assessed by using the [Information Selection and Assessment framework](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015WR017044).

Details about the framework and its application to the Lake Como basin are provided in Giuliani et al. "Improving seasonal forecasts through the state of multiple climate signals to inform water reservoir operations" submitted to Water Resources Research. The code has been adapted from the original version of NIPA developed by Brian Zimmerman and Paul Block.
